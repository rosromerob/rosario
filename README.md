Exercise: Describe yourself

Colombia is my country of naissance. So then, I can speak Spanish and I try my best to use this language in a proper way when it is meant to be. But, sometimes, when I speak friendly, I like to change the gender of the words. Here some of the examples: 
"Me tengo que arreglar la pelo"
"Esto me parece horriblo"
